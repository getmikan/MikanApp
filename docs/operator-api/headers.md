# ClashFest Operator API — header reference

Status legend:

- **v1** — implemented now (or planned for the current branch)
- **v2** — planned next wave (extended operator info + policy display)
- **v3** — later (operator-controlled UI simplification)
- **proposed** — accepted into the spec, not yet scheduled

All headers are matched case-insensitively. Empty / blank values are treated
as "header not present". String fields may be plain UTF-8 or `base64:`-prefixed
(`X-Brand-Name: base64:U3dpZnRWUE4=`) — the client decodes both.

ClashFest's primary theme is dark. Wherever a "light" alternative exists,
it's the optional override.

## 0. Master switch

### `X-Branding-Enabled`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | boolean |
| Status | **v1** |
| Required for | **Any cosmetic branding to apply.** Without this header set to `true`, every `X-Brand-*` identity/tab/info field is ignored and the client shows the default ClashFest UI. **Exception:** operator *policy* headers (§4b, e.g. `X-Brand-Hide-Global-Mode`) apply without this switch. |
| Default | absent / `false` / `null` → **branding off** |
| Notes | Branding is **explicit opt-in per subscription**. Setting `X-Brand-Name`, `X-Brand-Logo-URL`, etc. without also sending `X-Branding-Enabled: true` is a no-op — the headers are parsed and persisted, but the UI stays default. To roll back a misconfigured deployment, drop this header (or set `false`); brand state on the client reverts immediately after the next subscription refresh. |

**Example to enable branding:**
```
X-Branding-Enabled: true
X-Brand-Name: SwiftVPN
X-Brand-Logo-URL: https://cdn.example.com/logo-dark.png
X-Brand-Accent-Color: #5E35B1
```

**Example to disable / kill switch:**
```
X-Branding-Enabled: false
```

## 1. Brand identity

### `X-Brand-Name`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | string |
| Max length | 32 characters |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | Main screen header title (replaces "ClashFest"); About screen |
| Fallback | "ClashFest" |
| Validation | trimmed; control characters stripped; blank → ignored |

**Example:**
```
X-Brand-Name: SwiftVPN
```

### `X-Brand-Tagline`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | string |
| Max length | 64 characters |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | About screen subtitle; optional small subtitle under the brand name in the main header |
| Fallback | empty (no tagline shown) |

**Example:**
```
X-Brand-Tagline: Fast and private since 2024
```

### `X-Brand-Logo-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL (https only) |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | Round logo tile in main header (left of brand name); About screen icon |
| Image formats | PNG, WebP, JPEG. **No SVG** (see security.md) |
| Recommended size | 256×256, ≤200KB |
| Max size enforced | 512KB hard cap |
| Cache | disk at `<filesDir>/brand/<sha256(url)>`, atomic write |
| Validation | https-only, content-type whitelist, SSRF guard (no private IPs / redirects to private IPs), size cap |
| Fallback | app launcher icon |
| Notes | This is the **primary** logo, used by default. It's expected to look right on a dark background since dark is the app's default theme. |

**Example:**
```
X-Brand-Logo-URL: https://swiftvpn.example.com/static/logo-256.png
```

### `X-Brand-Logo-Light-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL (https only) |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | Same as `X-Brand-Logo-URL` but used when the user is on the light theme |
| Validation | same as `X-Brand-Logo-URL` |
| Fallback | `X-Brand-Logo-URL` (so a dark-tuned logo is still used on light theme if the operator didn't ship a light variant) |
| Notes | Optional. Most operators only need to ship one logo. |

### `X-Brand-Accent-Color`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | hex color `#RRGGBB` |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | Global `colorPrimary` runtime override — affects power button, toggles, switches, progress bars, filled chips, selected states, accent surfaces across the app |
| Validation | regex `^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$`; rejected if luminance contrast with surface is < 3:1 (WCAG AA minimum for large text) |
| Fallback | built-in theme accent |
| Notes | This is a "full white-label" knob. Pick a color that works in both the dark and the light theme (the contrast filter will reject one-side-only colors). Recommended saturation 30–70% so accent stays visible without being garish. |

**Example:**
```
X-Brand-Accent-Color: #5E35B1
```

---

## 2. Operator info / external links

All URL fields share the same validation: must be `https://`, `tg://`,
`mailto:`, or `t.me/` (auto-promoted to `https://t.me/`). Anything else
is ignored.

### `X-Brand-Website-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | About screen → "Visit website" button |

### `X-Brand-Support-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL |
| Status | **v1** (extension of existing `support-url` parsing) |
| Applied to | Support icon in profile card and bottom sheet; About screen |

> Backwards compatibility: also accepts `support-url`, `Profile-Support-URL`,
> and `Subscription-Support-URL`. If both `X-Brand-Support-URL` and a legacy
> form are present, `X-Brand-Support-URL` wins.

### `X-Brand-Telegram-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL (https / tg / t.me) |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | About screen → "Telegram channel" button |

### `X-Brand-Bot-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL (https / tg / t.me) |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | About screen → "Telegram bot" button (separate from channel) |

### `X-Brand-Privacy-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | About screen → "Privacy policy" link |

### `X-Brand-Terms-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | About screen → "Terms of service" link |

### `X-Brand-Help-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | About screen → "FAQ" / "Help center" button |

### `X-Brand-Status-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL |
| Status | **v2** |
| Applied to | Connection-lost dialog / failed-fetch dialog → "Check service status" button |

### `X-Brand-Renew-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL |
| Status | **v2** |
| Applied to | When subscription expiry is critical (<3 days or already expired):<br>• tap on the existing critical-expiry chip on the profile card<br>• "Renew" button in the profile bottom sheet near the expiry info<br>• "Renew subscription" entry in the profile overflow menu<br>About screen also gets a Renew button when this URL is set. |
| Notes | All entry points appear only when this URL is provided. No URL → no Renew UI anywhere. |

### `X-Brand-Cabinet-URL`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL (https / tg / mailto) — almost always built with a panel template variable |
| Status | **v3** |
| Applied to | "My account" button on the **Operator** tab, rendered as a tonal-secondary button under the Renew CTA (or alone if no Renew URL). |
| Notes | The operator builds a **per-user** URL using their panel's identifier template — e.g. `{{SHORT_UUID}}`, `{{ID}}`, `{{USERNAME}}`. Examples:<br>• Telegram Mini App: `https://t.me/<bot>?startapp={{SHORT_UUID}}` (requires the bot to be registered as a Mini App in BotFather).<br>• Web cabinet: `https://billing.example.com/account?ref={{ID}}`<br>• Bot chat with start payload: `https://t.me/<bot>?start={{SHORT_UUID}}` (operator must handle the payload in `/start` and surface the cabinet button).<br>Client opens the URL via `ACTION_VIEW` — Android routes `tg://` / `https://t.me/...` to Telegram (Mini App or chat depending on the URL form), other `https://` to the browser. |

---

## 3. User context

The client uses **only one** field for user-facing identity. Per-user
personalisation lives in `profile-title` — operators put whatever they
want there (`vasya@example.com — Premium`, `John (Trial, 2d left)`, etc).
Free-form, panel-controlled.

### `profile-title` (existing, non-Brand)

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | string |
| Status | **v1** (already parsed) |
| Applied to | Profile card title |
| Notes | Carries the subscription plan label. For per-user identity / greeting, see the new headers below — modern panels support template variables that substitute user data into headers at request time. |

### `X-Brand-User-Display-Name`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | string |
| Max length | 64 characters |
| Status | **v2** |
| Applied to | "Logged in as <name>" line in About sheet (under the brand identity block) |
| Notes | Designed to be filled via a panel template variable, e.g. `X-Brand-User-Display-Name: {{USERNAME}}`. See [template-variables.md](template-variables.md) for the full list per panel. |

### `X-Brand-Greeting`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | string |
| Max length | 120 characters |
| Status | **v2** |
| Applied to | Hero line on the Operator tab, between the brand-identity block and the Renew CTA |
| Notes | Free-form. Operators typically wire dynamic content here via panel templates, e.g. `X-Brand-Greeting: Welcome back, {{USERNAME}}! {{DAYS_LEFT}} days remaining`. If absent but `X-Brand-User-Display-Name` is set, the client falls back to a built-in "Hello, <name>!". |

---

## 4. UX defaults — operator-controlled simplification

These let an operator hide advanced sections of the app from their users.
None of them is enforcement — the user can always re-enable an advanced
section through deep settings, the operator just chooses what to surface
by default.

We deliberately do **not** ship operator-controlled `default-mode`,
`recommended-group`, `locale`, or `theme` headers — mihomo already
handles tunnel mode and group selection via the YAML config, and locale /
theme should follow user preference, not operator preference.

### `X-Brand-Show-Operator-Tab`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | boolean |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | Adds a dedicated "Operator" entry to the bottom navigation with logo + name + tagline + Renew CTA + operator-info link list. |
| Notes | Explicit opt-in. Sending brand identity (name / logo / accent) alone is enough to brand the visuals — it does NOT auto-add a tab. Operators that want the consolidated info page choose it consciously. Pair with `X-Brand-Hide-Routing` to put Operator in Routing's slot instead of adding a 5th tab. |

### `X-Brand-Hide-Routing`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | boolean |
| Status | **v1** |
| Applied to | Hides the Routing tab from the bottom nav, leaving Home / Profiles / Settings (three tabs). When paired with `X-Brand-Show-Operator-Tab=true`, the Operator tab takes Routing's slot instead (still 4 tabs, just a different middle). Needs brand identity (name / logo / accent) like every cosmetic header. |

---

## 4b. Operator policy — applies WITHOUT `X-Branding-Enabled`

Everything above (identity, operator tab, info links, greeting, hide-routing)
is **cosmetic branding** and requires `X-Branding-Enabled: true`. The headers
below are **operator policy** — restrictions on user behaviour, not a look —
so they apply on header presence alone, do **not** require branding to be
enabled, and survive the `X-Branding-Enabled: false` kill-switch (which only
wipes cosmetic branding).

### `X-Brand-Hide-Global-Mode`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | boolean |
| Status | **v4** |
| Needs `X-Branding-Enabled`? | **No** — policy headers work fully unbranded. |
| Applied to | Hides the Home **Global** mode button and pins the app to **Rule** (if the user was in Global, it flips back to Rule). The "Mode" row and the Rule button stay visible. |
| Notes | Operator control, not branding: stops users from routing all traffic through the proxy and bypassing rules. Because it's policy, it takes effect whether `X-Branding-Enabled` is absent, `true`, or `false`. Every non-policy `X-Brand-*` header still requires `X-Branding-Enabled: true`. |

### `X-Brand-Lock-Config-Script`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | boolean |
| Status | **v5** |
| Needs `X-Branding-Enabled`? | **No** — operator policy, same as `X-Brand-Hide-Global-Mode`. |
| Applied to | Forbids user [config scripts](https://github.com/Nemu-x/ClashFest/wiki/Config-Scripts) on this subscription. The editor becomes read-only and any script already stored on the profile stops running. |
| Notes | A config script rewrites the config wholesale — `proxies`, `dns`, `rules` — so on a managed subscription it is a way around whatever policy you set. Enforcement happens when the config is **built**, not only in the UI: a script a user saved before you set this flag stops running too, so turning the flag on is retroactive. Survives the `X-Branding-Enabled: false` kill-switch. |

**Example:**
```
X-Brand-Lock-Config-Script: true
```

### `X-Brand-Primary-Proxy-Group`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | string (proxy group name; `base64:` prefix accepted for non-ASCII) |
| Alias | `X-Brand-PrimaryProxyGroup` |
| Status | proposed |
| Needs `X-Branding-Enabled`? | **No** |
| Applied to | The Home **Node** row, the VPN notification's node line and the profile card's "Group · Server" line show the node currently selected in this group (nested groups resolved to the leaf). |
| Fallback | Group not present in the running config, or the app is in **Global** mode → the default choice (Global: `GLOBAL`; otherwise the group the user last picked a node in, then the first group). |
| Notes | Display only — it never selects a node or changes routing. Max 128 characters. Quotes around the value are stripped. |

```
X-Brand-Primary-Proxy-Group: Proxy
X-Brand-PrimaryProxyGroup: base64:0J/RgNC+0LrRgdC4
```

---

### `X-Brand-Proxy-Group-Layout`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `tabs` \| `dropdown` (also accepted: `tab`, `list`, `accordion`) |
| Alias | `X-Brand-ProxyGroupLayout` |
| Status | proposed |
| Needs `X-Branding-Enabled`? | **No** |
| Applied to | Default layout of the node picker opened from the Home **Node** row: `tabs` = one group at a time behind a row of group tabs; `dropdown` = every group as a collapsible row showing its current choice, nodes listed under the expanded ones. |
| Fallback | Absent / unknown value → `tabs`. |
| Notes | A **default only**: the picker has a layout toggle, and once the user has used it their choice wins over this header for good. |

```
X-Brand-Proxy-Group-Layout: dropdown
```

---

## 5. Subscription policy

### `Subscription-Userinfo` (existing)

| | |
|---|---|
| Format | `upload=N; download=N; total=N; expire=UNIX` |
| Status | **v1** (already parsed) |
| Applied to | Quota progress on profile card, critical-expiry chip |

### `profile-update-interval` (existing)

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | integer (hours) |
| Status | **v1** (already parsed) |
| Applied to | Auto-update interval, coerced to ≥15 min |

### `share-links` (existing)

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | boolean (`true`/`1`/`yes`/`on` = disable sharing) |
| Status | **v1** (already parsed) |
| Applied to | Hides "Copy node link" / "Share" actions in the picker AND locks subscription URL editing for **that subscription only** |
| Notes | Stored per-profile (`subscriptionShareLinksLockedFor(uuid)`). Different subscriptions can have different share policies — one operator's lock does not affect another's subscription on the same device. |

### REALITY with old and new Xray (client setting, no header)

Xray-core 26.9.8+ rejects a REALITY ClientHello without an X25519MLKEM768 key share, while Xray 24.x servers silently drop one that carries it, and a server never says which kind it is. Since 1.2.2 ClashFest settles this per server: in **Auto** (the default, **Settings → Network → "REALITY: ML-KEM key share"**) it tries the classic handshake first, switches after a failure and remembers what worked for each server and public key. **Always** / **Never** force one side. **"REALITY: client version"** sets the version reported to servers configured with `minClientVer` / `maxClientVer` (default `26.9.9`). A node shipped with `reality-opts.support-x25519mlkem768: true` always offers the key share, so operators on current Xray can still pin it in the subscription. Tested against Xray 24.12.31, 25.7.25, 26.4.13 and 26.9.9.

### `X-Network-Stack`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | enum: `system` \| `gvisor` \| `mixed` \| `mips` \| `auto` |
| Status | **v1** |
| Needs `X-Branding-Enabled`? | **No** — operator policy, applies unbranded. |
| Applied to | The TUN network stack handed to the VpnService. `system`/`gvisor`/`mixed`/`mips` **lock** the client to that stack for this subscription, overriding the user's manual Stack Mode setting. `auto` = operator does not lock (defer to the user setting / the `system` default). `mips` is mihomo's own pure-Go userspace stack (the engine default since 1.19.32), available in ClashFest from 1.1.1. |
| Default | Header absent → client default (`system`). |
| Notes | Stored per-profile (`subscriptionNetworkStackFor(uuid)`) like the share-links policy — different subscriptions can force different stacks on the same device. Precedence: **operator header > user's manual setting > Auto (follow the subscription's `tun.stack`) > `system` default** (see `TunStackResolver`). The app default is `system`; the user can pick `auto` to follow the subscription's declared `tun.stack`, and this header overrides both. `system` is recommended — the kernel stack is lower-latency on teardown and cheaper on battery than gVisor's userspace netstack; choose `gvisor`/`mixed` only when a device/network needs it. Accepted spellings (case-insensitive): `X-Network-Stack`, `Network-Stack`, `X-NetworkStack`, `X-NetworkStack-enabled`. |

**Example (lock all users of this subscription to the kernel stack):**
```
X-Network-Stack: system
```

### `X-Bypass-Preset`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | preset id: `ru` \| `ir` \| `cn` (any id bundled in `assets/bypass_presets/`), or `none` |
| Status | **v1** |
| Needs `X-Branding-Enabled`? | **No** — operator policy, applies unbranded. |
| Applied to | *Recommends* a regional per-app bypass preset (apps excluded from the VPN at the system level — local banks, government, marketplaces get the user's real ISP connection). On the next VPN start the client shows a confirm dialog: "Your provider recommends the &lt;region&gt; bypass preset. Found N installed apps — route them outside the VPN tunnel?" |
| Default | Header absent → keep whatever is stored; `none` → withdraw the recommendation. |
| Notes | **Recommendation only — never auto-applied.** Per-app bypass exposes the user's real IP to the bypassed apps, so it stays an explicit user decision; the header cannot silently move traffic out of the tunnel. **Re-offer rules:** the client remembers the answer per profile keyed by preset id + the *bundled list version*. If the user **applied** and a later app update ships a larger version of that list (its JSON `version` bumped), the client re-offers once ("list updated, +N apps — add?"). If the user **skipped**, that region is never offered again regardless of list growth. A *different* preset id (`ru`→`cn`) always offers. Applying is additive: the user's manual per-app selection is preserved, and the user can always re-apply or edit via Routing → Per-app → menu → "Apply bypass preset…". Unknown preset ids and presets matching zero installed apps are consumed silently. Stored per-profile (`subscriptionBypassPresetFor(uuid)`), cleared on profile delete. Accepted spellings (case-insensitive): `X-Bypass-Preset`, `bypass-preset`, `bypass_preset`. |

**Example (suggest the Russian bypass list to this subscription's users):**
```
X-Bypass-Preset: ru
```

### `x-hwid-active` / `x-hwid-not-supported` / `x-hwid-max-devices-reached` / `x-hwid-limit` (existing)

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | boolean |
| Status | **v1** (already parsed) |
| Applied to | HWID enforcement warnings on profile card |

---

## 6. Announcements

### `announce` / `Announcement` (existing)

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | string (UTF-8 or `base64:`) |
| Length | No hard cap — keep it to a few lines; the home card shows one line and the sheet the full text |
| Line breaks | A literal `\n` (two characters) is rendered as a line break; real newlines cannot travel in a header |
| Status | **v1** (already parsed) |
| Applied to | Home announcement card + announcement sheet |

### `announce-url` / `Announcement-URL` (existing)

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | URL |
| Status | **v1** (already parsed) |
| Applied to | Tap target for the announcement bar |

---

## 7. What the client sends with every subscription request

Panels can rely on these request headers (full detail in [supported-headers.md](../supported-headers.md)):

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `User-Agent` | `mihomo/<core version> ClashFest/<app version>`, e.g. `mihomo/1.19.32 ClashFest/1.2.2`. The core token leads because Marzban / Remnawave pick the Clash Meta format from the first token. A per-profile "User-Agent override" replaces the whole string. |
| `x-hwid` | SHA-256 of the package name and Android's per-app ID (hex), stable per install |
| `x-device-os` | `Android` |
| `x-ver-os` | Android release, e.g. `15` |
| `x-device-model` | Manufacturer + model |
| `x-app-version` | App version name |

---

## Implementation order

| Wave | Adds |
|---|---|
| **v1** | Section 1 (brand identity, all five) + section 2 entries (Website / Support / Telegram / Bot / Privacy / Terms / Help) + already-parsed sections 5 + 6 |
| **v2** | Section 2 v2 entries (Status-URL, Renew-URL) |
| **v3** | Section 4 (Hide-Routing) |
| proposed | Anything added by future PRs |

Anything not listed as a defined header is ignored. Operators are free to
send other custom headers — the client doesn't care.

## What we deliberately don't ship (and why)

Headers that were considered and rejected during the v1 design review:

- `X-Brand-User-Display-Name` / `User-Tier` / `User-Greeting` / `User-Flair` —
  per-user personalisation isn't possible on most panels through static
  response headers. The operator can already shape `profile-title`
  freely to carry user name, tier, and any other personal context.
- `X-Brand-Trial-Until` — covered by the existing `Subscription-Userinfo`
  `expire=` field plus the critical-expiry chip; no need for a parallel
  trial-specific channel.
- `X-Brand-Default-Mode` — mihomo already reads `mode:` from the YAML
  config, no need for a header equivalent.
- `X-Brand-Recommended-Group` — mihomo's Selector default already picks
  the first proxy in the configured list. Operators control this through
  the YAML, not headers. (Which group the UI *displays* is a different
  question — see `X-Brand-Primary-Proxy-Group`.)
- `X-Brand-Locale` / `X-Brand-Theme` — these are user preferences. Letting
  an operator override them silently is hostile UX, even when well-meant.
- `X-Brand-Max-Devices` / `X-Brand-Current-Devices` — without a current
  count the static chip read as filler; current count isn't reliably
  available across panels via response headers. Out of scope until the
  panel ecosystem catches up.

If a future use case actually demands one of these, it can be added under
`proposed` first and discussed.
